    what is the goal
        build model to make accurate predictions under the specified restrictions

    the nature of the problem
        e.g, it is a regression problem with both image data and categorical information

    nature of the data
        any factor about the data that challenges the goal

    plan for solving the problem (basically same purpose as a project plan (no larping though, e.g, no mentions of stakeholders or anything like that, just follow the same basic structure in a way that makes sense in the context))

        framework of the solution
            initial plan for model that is used to achieve the goal. only basic overview, no details. the concept of the model before any run is made and before the model is even built.
