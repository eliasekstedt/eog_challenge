* find optimal prediction value based on training data. submitt as guess for all datapoints
* train the simplest model applicable to the problem (based on the nature of the data). submitt to quantify the improvement
* create a basic version of the main model that will be used in the project. begin simple moving to more complex, noting submission results along the way
